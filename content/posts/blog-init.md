## What is this blog?
I started writing articles back in 2012, ranging from travel logs to programming tutorials in PHP. I enjoy writing texts here and then when I find (or dont find) certain things that might be interesting for others. All those articles I wrote in the past years were spread over different platforms, including self-written blog websites using flatfile storage...

A lot of these platforms, including Medium, Patreon and Ko-Fi are missing fundamentals like syntax highlighting without using screenshots or github gists, which can be very annoying considering the type of content I focus on. Other platforms have such a big overhead, that it got annoying updating, handling and keeping track, since I'm only doing such articles when I'm feeling like it.

This blog will be a revamp of everything. I'll focus on small, comprehensive articles about obstacles I come across, mixed in with some larger articles about passionate projects.

## Where can you find my old stuff?

The ones that are still online are scattered over [Medium](https://medium.com/@alexotter), [Patreon](https://patreon.com/alexottr) and [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/alexottr), usually being publicly accessible unless they include *behind-the-scene* content.

# Am I gonna maintain this blog?

I'll certainly try. I can't promise that it will be a steady upload but I will try.


Thanks for reading <3
